<h1>The Best Movies According to Parameswaran</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Batman : The Dark Knight</h3>
<p>This is Batman at it's peak...In all other batman movies it is inferred that gotham is a place that is overun by crime and corruption but this movie dives into the roots of Gotham. It highlights how even someone who is pure of heart can be changed when the need arises</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Mind, time and brain bending sci-fi movie.</p>
<h3>Coco</h3>
<p>Everyone loves a feel good movie afterall right?</p>
